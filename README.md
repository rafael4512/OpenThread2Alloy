# OpenThread2Alloy

This repository was developed as part of my Master's dissertation, "Formalization of a Mesh protocol for IoT systems on Alloy".
____

### Description 

<a href="https://openthread.io/">Openthread</a>, released by Google, is an open source implementation of the Thread protocol, which has recently been highlighted with the emergence of Mesh networks and the emergence of IoT, since it was designed for low energy consumption networks, namely for SmartHomes scenarios. Thus, this repository is a possible formalization of the operation of this protocol.

<a href="https://alloytools.org/">Alloy</a> was used as a tool that allows the modeling and structural analysis of software design. The <a href="https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-network-simulator">OpenThread Network Simulator (OTNS)</a> was used to verify the models produced in Alloy.

Thus, in this repository you can find the Alloy models, a java program capable of running all the tests presented in the dissertation and also a parser capable of translating any simulation performed in OTNS to an instance of Alloy.

### Shorcuts:
- ðŸ“‚ Alloy Models - All models produced in Alloy can be found here.
- ðŸ“‚ Tester -  All the tests performed in the dissertation can be produced again through this java program.
- ðŸ“‚ Parser - The Parser can be found here.
